	<p>A decennial is essentially the same concept as a <a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=biennial">biennial</a> except it happens once every ten year—i.e., every decade—instead of every other year. You can tell this be the prefix. "bi-" is the Latin prefix for two, and "dec-" is the prefix for ten.</p>
	<p>A decent example of a decennial event is the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/death-valley-in-bloom-rare-flowers-appear-once-every-10-years">super bloom of wildflowers in Death Valley.</a> While not always exactly ten years, the trend is for it to happen once a decade.</p>
