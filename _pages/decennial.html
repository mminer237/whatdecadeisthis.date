	<p>A decennial is essentially the same concept as a <a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=biennial">biennial</a> except it happens once every ten year—i.e., every decade—instead of every other year. You can tell this be the prefix. "bi-" is the Latin prefix for two, and "dec-" is the prefix for ten.</p>

		<dd>The US Census is one of the biggest decennial events. Beginning in <a href="/1790">1790</a>, the census has continued to happen <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/demographic/decennial_census.html" title="Decennial Census - History - U.S. Census Bureau">every ten years since then</a>. Many other countries follow this frequency, including the United Kingdom, Singapore, Kenya, Austria, Chile, and Romania.</dd>
