	<p>"Negative" years, or years <dfn title="Before Christ">BC</dfn>, are years before <a href="/1">AD 1</a>. (Because <a href="/0">there is no year 0</a>, negative or positive.) I don't have separate pages for BC years, but if you look at the same year AD, it'll be the same century number. E.g., 764 BC is 77th decade BC, as you can see because <a href="/764">AD 764</a> the <a href="/77th-decade">77th decade AD</a>.</p>
