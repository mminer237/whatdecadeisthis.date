<p><strong>WandaVision episode 6 skips ahead a bit to be based on <a href="/2000s">the 2000s</a>.</strong> <a href="https://www.imcdb.org/movie.php?resultsStyle=asList&sortBy=6&id=9140560">The cars don't really catch up</a>, but this episode is specifically a homage to <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>, which ran from <a href="/2000">2000</a> to <a href="/2006">2006</a>. It tries to invoke both that series' tone, as well as its humor. Its title also references the common practice of sitcoms having holiday-specific episodes, but that is not specific to any time period.</p>
