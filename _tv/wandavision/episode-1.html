<p>WandaVision episode 1 opens the show with a somewhat jarring and confusing portrayal of Wanda Maximoff and her deceased robot boyfriend, Vision, living as a happy-married couple in a light-hearted sitcom.</p>
<p><strong>This episode is based on <a href="/1950s">the 1950s</a>.</strong> Even though its primary inspiration is <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> of <a href="/1960s">the 1960s</a>, the episode's clothing, cars, and hairstyles are all very 1950s-based. Another significant unnamed influence is <i>I Love Lucy</i>, which did air in the 1950s.</p>
