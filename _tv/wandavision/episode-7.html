<p><strong>WandaVision episode 7 is based on the late <a href="/2000s">2000s</a> and early <a href="/2010s">2010s</a>.</strong> This is the last episode before it just primarily stays in the present day. As things continue to blur into just being "modern", some dating can still be done by the episode's references. Most obviously, this episode parodies <i>The Office</i> both in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUWHOajCNs">its crescendoing, piano-based theme song</a>, titled <i>W-V <a href="2000">2000</a></i>, and in its frequent "talking head" segments.</p>
