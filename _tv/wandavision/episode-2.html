<p>The second episode of WandaVision <em>heavily</em> references <i>Bewitched</i>. As you might infer by this heavy referencing, <strong>it is set in <a href="/1960s">the 1960s</a></strong>, like <i>Bewitched</i> is. It even used the actual house from <i>Bewitched</i> in the episode. It was filmed in black-and-white, and it used '60s techniques and special effects to make it as authentic as possible. It also has minor references to other 1960s shows like <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> and <i>The Twilight Zone</i>.</p>
