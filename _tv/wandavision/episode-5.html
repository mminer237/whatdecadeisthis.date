<p>WandaVision's fifth episode returns to Wanda's story, <strong>now in <a href="/1980s">the 1980s</a></strong>. This episode doesn't reference any particular '80s sitcom so much as it does all sitcoms of the <a href="/199th-decade">199th decade</a> collectively. Even the name is a reference to the shows having "very special episodes" about difficult, serious topics, a trend which was especially popular in the '80s (as well as neighboring decades, <a href="/1970s">the '70s</a> and <a href="/1990s">the '90s</a>).</p>
<p>In addition other obvious things from the '80s are present, such as the somewhat improved color palette, the '80s curls, the aggressive colors, <a href="https://www.imcdb.org/movie.php?resultsStyle=asList&sortBy=6&id=9140560">'80s cars</a>, and copious amounts of plaid.</p>
