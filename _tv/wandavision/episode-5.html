<p>WandaVision's fifth episode returns to Wanda's story, <strong>now in <a href="/1980s">the 1980s</a></strong>. This episode doesn't reference any particular '80s sitcom so much as it does all sitcoms of the <a href="/199th-decade">199th decade</a> collectively. Even the name is a reference to the shows having "very special episodes" about difficult, serious topics, a trend which was especially popular in and around the '80s.</p>
<p>In addition other obvious things from the '80s are present, such as the somewhat improved color palette, the '80s curls, the aggressive colors, '80s cars, and copious amounts of plaid.</p>
