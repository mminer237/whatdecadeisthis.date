	<p>This site explains decades and how years are categorized. </p>

<section>
	<h2>Current Year</h2>
	<p>Because it is currently {{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}, I am assuming you want to look at that year: <a href="{{ site.url }}/{{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}">{{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}</a></p>
	<p>However, you can alternatively look at any year within reason.</p>
</section>
<section id="search-section">
	<h2 id="search-header">Go To Year</h2>
	<form>
		<input id="search-box" aria-labelledby="search-header" type="number" min="-{{ site.lastYear }}" max="{{ site.lastYear }}" autocomplete="off">
		<button id="search-button">Go To Year</button>
	</form>
	<noscript>
		<style>
			#search-box {
				display: none;
			}
		</style>
		You will have to type the year manually in the URL without JS.
